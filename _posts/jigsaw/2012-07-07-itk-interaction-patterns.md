This is the first in a series of articles I will be writing about my experiments building an ITK compliant framework called Jigsaw.

The goals of the project are to 

* Gain a thorough understanding of the ITK requirements
* Build a set of ITK components
* Have them accredited by the NHS

Jigsaw is an open source framework licensed under MIT.

Building Jigsaw will provide me with an opportunity to explore areas in ITK such as digitally signing a message, interaction patterns and looking at the
ITK Testbench that is provided with the ITK pack. 

The [Interoperability Toolkit](http://www.connectingforhealth.nhs.uk/systemsandservices/interop/) site describes ITK as

A set of standards and frameworks for making IT systems interoperable. 

It follows the strategy to 'connect all' rather than 'replace all', endorsed in the government White Paper, 'Equity & Excellence: Liberating the NHS'.

It is not a set of software tools, though the test bench does provide some very nice features developers can make use of to test their software.
